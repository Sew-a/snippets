              Flexbox has taken over the front-end layout together with css
              grid. These are a set of mixins to quickly develop with it, the
              names are pretty self-descriptive and I highly use them because I
              always forget which one represents the main axis and which one the
              cross axis.

            <p>
              There is an inner fire, fueled in every member of the studio. It
              comes from what we surround ourselves with, from the games we
              play, from where we live and who we are accompanied by.
            </p>
            <span
              >We want to hone that fire and make it grow. Itâ€™s what makes the
              games we create so unique. As a studio, we have one mission:
              making the best video games on the planet. We want to tell
              breathtaking, mature stories to global audiences, without losing
              the attention to detail that has made us who we are today.</span
