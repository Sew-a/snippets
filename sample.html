          Flexbox has taken over the front-end layout together with css grid.
          These are a set of mixins to quickly develop with it, the names are
          pretty self-descriptive and I highly use them because I always forget
          which one represents the main axis and which one the cross axis.

        <a>OUR MISSION</a>
        <p>
          There is an inner fire, fueled in every member of the studio. It comes
          from what we surround ourselves with, from the games we play, from
          where we live and who we are accompanied by.
        </p>
        <span
          >We want to hone that fire and make it grow. Itâ€™s what makes the games
          we create so unique. As a studio, we have one mission: making the best
          video games on the planet. We want to tell breathtaking, mature
          stories to global audiences, without losing the attention to detail
          that has made us who we are today.</span
